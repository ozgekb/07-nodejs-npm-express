## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This application is a blog with post from various authors and categories. It now loads JSON data from a file via a getJson and loads that data for the user. We now can use node.js to get requests and post response. Now users can directly reach the new.html page.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

Read through the documentation for this lab. Have an understaning of node.js and install npm and express.js. They need to create package,json and package-lock.json and also they need to add node_modules to .gitignore. Lastly, they need to write code inside the server to create get and post.

## Architecture

JSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, node.js, express.js.
